# Face Detection System

This project involved creating a face detection system using OpenCV. The system utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in real-time from video streams. Additionally, a simple face recognition model using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm was implemented, enabling the identification of multiple individuals based on labeled images. This project provided hands-on experience in computer vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detects faces in video streams using Haar Cascade classifiers.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies multiple individuals based on labeled image datasets using the LBPH algorithm.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Improved detection accuracy and recognition speed through optimization techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
